## In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application

OAuth, in simple terms, provides a way for your application to allow users to access their accounts on other websites or services without sharing their passwords with your application. It's like having a magic key that lets you into different places without needing to know all the door codes.
For example, when you want to sign in to a website using your Google or Facebook account, you're using OAuth. You grant permission to that website to access certain information from your Google or Facebook account, like your name and profile picture, so you don't have to create a new account and remember another password.
