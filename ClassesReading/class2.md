## Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples

Built-in packages in programming are like ready-to-use toolboxes that come with the programming language. They provide pre-written code for specific tasks, saving time and effort. For example,In Java, the "java.util" package provides useful utilities like "ArrayList" for dynamic arrays, "HashMap" for key-value pairs, and "Date" for handling dates and times. These packages act as a toolkit, offering readily available functionalities to simplify coding tasks in Java programs.

## Explain the steps for creating a new package in IntelliJ

- Launch IntelliJ IDEA and open your project.
- In the Project view, locate the source directory where you want to create the new package. Usually, the source directory is named "src."
- Right-click on the source directory where you want to create the package.
- From the context menu, hover over "New" and then select "Package."
- Enter Package Name.
- Click OK.

## Which loop types use a loop counter?

- For Loop.
- Do-While Loop.

## Explain the difference between While and Do-While loops

In a while loop, the loop condition is checked before entering the loop body. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop body is executed. If the condition is false from the beginning, the loop body is never executed. In contrast a do-while loop, the loop body is executed first, and then the loop condition is checked. This guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

## Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays

- Arrays.toString(): It returns a string containing the elements of the array, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets.
- Arrays.sort(): This method is used to sort the elements of an array in ascending order.
- Arrays.copyOf(): This method is used to create a copy of an array with a specified length

## How is the size of an array determined in Java?

The size of an array is determined at the time of its creation, Once the array is created, its length cannot be changed, If you need to change the size of an array, you have to create a new array with the desired size and copy the elements from the old array to the new one.
