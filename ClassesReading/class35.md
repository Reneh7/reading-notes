# Graphs

## Explain a Detail in Depth

Graphs in Java are data structures that consist of nodes (vertices) and edges. Nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between these entities. There are two main types of graphs: directed and undirected. In directed graphs, edges have a direction, while in undirected graphs, edges have no direction. Additionally, graphs can be weighted, where each edge has a numerical weight. This weight could represent distances, costs, etc. Understanding these concepts is crucial for efficient graph implementation.

## Tutorial / Walk Through an Example

Let's consider a simple example of representing a social network using an undirected graph. Each person is a node, and a friendship between two people is an edge. In Java, you might use a combination of classes to represent nodes and edges. You can then create a Graph class that manages these nodes and edges. A method like addEdge(Node source, Node destination) would establish a friendship. This example illustrates the practical application of graphs in modeling relationships.

## WHY, WHAT, HOW structure

WHY: Understanding the Significance of Graphs in Java
Graphs play a pivotal role in Java programming for modeling and solving real-world problems where relationships and connections between entities are crucial. Whether it's representing social networks, mapping routes, or solving optimization problems, graphs provide a versatile and powerful abstraction. By leveraging graphs, developers can create efficient solutions for various scenarios, making them a fundamental data structure in Java applications.

### WHAT: Essential Concepts of Graphs in Java

- Nodes and Edges:
Node: Represents entities in the graph.
Edge: Represents relationships between nodes.
- Types of Graphs:
Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction.
Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have direction.
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights.
- Java Implementation:
Node Class: Represents entities in the graph.
Edge Class: Represents relationships between nodes.
Graph Class: Manages nodes and edges.

### HOW: Implementing Graphs in Java

- Node and Edge Classes:
class Node {
    int data;
}
class Edge {
    Node source;
    Node destination;
    int weight;
    }

- Graph Class:
class Graph {
    List<Node> nodes;
    List<Edge> edges;
    }
