## What does it mean to authenticate a user?

Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of an individual or entity seeking access to a system or resource. It involves verifying the user's provided credentials, such as a username and password, biometric data, or other authentication methods like tokens or smart cards. The goal is to ensure that only authorized users can gain access, enhancing security and protecting sensitive data. Authentication is a fundamental component of cybersecurity, safeguarding digital systems and resources from unauthorized access and potential breaches.

## What does it mean to authorize a user?

Authorizing a user refers to the process of determining what actions or resources a user is permitted to access or perform within a system or application once their identity has been authenticated. Authorization involves defining and enforcing access control policies and permissions based on the user's role, privileges, or attributes. This process ensures that users can only interact with data and functionalities that they are explicitly allowed to use, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data integrity and security. Authorization mechanisms typically involve defining user roles, setting up access controls, and applying policies that dictate who can do what within a system. It complements authentication by specifying what actions a user can take after their identity has been verified.

## What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?

- Successful Authentication: This outcome indicates that the provided credentials (username and password) or authentication token are valid, and the user is successfully authenticated. In this case, the method returns an authenticated Authentication object.
- Failed Authentication: If the provided credentials or token are invalid or do not match any user in the system, authentication fails. The method returns an exception or a specific error indicating authentication failure. Common exceptions include BadCredentialsException, LockedException, or DisabledException, depending on the reason for the failure.
- Exception: In some cases, an unexpected error may occur during the authentication process that is not related to the provided credentials. In such cases, the method may throw an exception that needs to be handled appropriately by the application. This could include database connection errors, server issues, or other unexpected problems.
