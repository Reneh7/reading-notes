# Class Four Reading

## Explain the difference between an object and a class

Object: An object is a tangible instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that encapsulates both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).

Class: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure, attributes, and methods that the objects created from it will possess. 

## Name two types of state that a Student object might have

- studentName
- studentAge

## Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have

- submitAssignments
- checkGrades

## Explain the significance of a constructor for a class

A constructor in a class holds significant importance as it serves as a special method responsible for initializing the newly created objects of that class. It enables the setting up of initial values for the object's attributes or fields, ensuring that the object is in a valid and usable state from the moment of creation. Constructors allow for encapsulation and abstraction by providing a controlled and consistent way to create instances of a class.
