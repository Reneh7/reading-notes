## What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it?

In Android Studio, an "Intent" serves as a versatile component for facilitating communication and triggering actions within Android applications. Examples of its usage include launching specific activities, invoking external actions like opening web pages or making phone calls, starting background services for tasks like file downloads or music playback.

## Describe an Activity in your own word:

an "Activity" can be thought of as a self-contained screen or user interface element that represents a specific interaction or function within an app. Activities play a pivotal role in the user's journey through the app, providing a visual interface for tasks like displaying information, capturing user input, or navigating to other parts of the application. Each activity has its own lifecycle and is typically associated with a single screen or user interface layout, making it a fundamental building block for creating interactive and responsive Android apps.
