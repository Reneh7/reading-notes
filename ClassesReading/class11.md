## What role do the @Controller classes play in a Spring MVC application?

 @Controller classes serve as the request-handling backbone. They receive incoming HTTP requests, process them by executing specific handler methods, and then determine which view should be rendered as the response. These classes encapsulate the application's business logic, interact with services and data sources, and populate model objects with data. Once the processing is complete, the controller method returns a logical view name, and the Spring framework takes care of rendering the corresponding view, combining it with model data. @Controller classes are pivotal in maintaining a clear separation of concerns within the application, making it easy to manage the flow of requests and the generation of responses.

## Explain to a non-technical friend what a GET request is

A GET request is like asking a web page for information. When you type a website's address into your browser and hit Enter, you're sending a GET request. It's like telling the server, "Hey, I'd like to see what's on this page." The server then sends back the webpage you asked for, and your browser shows it to you. It's a way for your computer to politely request data from another computer, typically used for things like loading web pages, showing images, or retrieving search results.

## What annotation should be placed on your Spring Boot application class?

@SpringBootApplication. This annotation combines three commonly used Spring annotations:

- @Configuration: Indicates that the class contains Spring bean definitions.
- @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot's automatic configuration based on the project's dependencies and environment.
- @ComponentScan: Instructs Spring to scan for and automatically configure Spring components (such as controllers, services, and repositories) in the current package and its subpackages.

## What method allows for a variable defined in Java (in your Spring Controller) to be dispalyed in HTML with the help of Thymeleaf?

 Using Thymeleaf expressions you can place your Java variables in the model (usually a Model object) and then reference them in the HTML template using Thymeleaf expressions enclosed in ${}.

## Explain the role of a @Controller class in a Spring MVC application

A class annotated with @Controller serves as a central hub for handling HTTP requests. It defines methods that are responsible for processing these requests, executing application logic, and preparing data for rendering in views. These methods return logical view names, which Spring resolves to actual view templates for rendering.

## What is a model attribute refered to in Thymeleaf?

A model attribute refers to an object or data that is made available to the view template for rendering. These attributes are typically set in the Spring Controller methods using annotations like @ModelAttribute. Once set, these attributes can be accessed directly within the HTML template to dynamically generate content or display data from the model in the view.
