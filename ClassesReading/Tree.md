Lesson: Exploring Tree Data Structures

Introduction: Imagine you're building a family tree, where each person in the family represents a "node." This is similar to how computers organize data with tree structures. 

Why Trees? Trees are like the family trees of computer science. They help us efficiently organize and retrieve data. Think of them as a way to avoid long, messy lists.

What Are Trees? In a tree, you have nodes connected by branches. The top node is called the "root." Nodes below it are "children," and nodes with no children are "leaves." It's a hierarchy!

Types of Trees:

Binary Trees: Nodes have, at most, two children.
AVL Trees: A type of binary tree that stays balanced for efficient searching.
Red-Black Trees: Another balanced binary tree with coloring rules.
And many more!

How Do Trees Work? Let's build a simple binary search tree together:

Start with the root node.
Add nodes to the left if they're smaller and to the right if they're larger.
This structure makes searching super quick!

Tree Data Structures Cheat Sheet

I. Basics:

A. What is a Tree? - A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. - Starts with a single node called the "root." - Nodes have parent-child relationships.

B. Common Terms: - Root: The top node in a tree. - Node: An element in the tree with data and references. - Edge: A connection between nodes. - Parent Node: A node with child nodes. - Child Node: A node connected to a parent node. - Leaf Node: A node with no children.

C. Types of Trees:

1. Binary Trees: Nodes have at most two children.

2. Binary Search Trees (BST): A binary tree with left nodes <= parent, right nodes > parent.

3. AVL Trees: A self-balancing binary search tree.

4. Red-Black Trees: Another balanced binary search tree. II.

Operations:

A. Insertion: - Adding a new node to the tree.

B. Deletion: - Removing a node from the tree.

C. Search: - Finding a node with a specific value.

D. Traversal: - Visiting all nodes in the tree.
