## Where in your application should you check the current auth session?

In a typical application, checking the current authentication session is a critical step that is often performed at the entry points or key access-controlled areas, such as when a user attempts to access secured resources or interacts with sensitive functionalities. This check is commonly implemented in middleware or interceptor layers to ensure that the user has the necessary authentication tokens or credentials before proceeding with the requested action. By placing this check strategically at key junctures in the application flow, developers can enforce security measures consistently, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring a seamless, protected user experience throughout the application.

## what is the command that is used to push your changes to the cloud?

To push changes to the cloud is typically "amplify push." After making modifications to the local project, including changes to the data model or backend configuration, developers execute the "amplify push" command. This command initiates a deployment process, pushing the changes to the configured cloud services, such as AWS.

## What does Amplify Auth do for your application?

Amplify Auth is a service provided by the Amplify framework that simplifies the implementation of authentication and user management features in a mobile or web application. It offers a set of pre-built, customizable authentication components and workflows, making it easier for developers to incorporate secure user sign-up, sign-in, and account management functionalities. Amplify Auth supports various authentication mechanisms, including email/password, social identity providers (such as Google and Facebook), and multi-factor authentication. It also provides features like user authentication state tracking, password recovery, and customizable UI components. By integrating Amplify Auth, developers can enhance the security of their applications and streamline the implementation of user authentication, allowing them to focus more on building other core features of their applications.
