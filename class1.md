## Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript

Imagine I speak Arabic and I want to send a message to my friend who only speaks English. I need to convert this message into English for my friend to understand it. Similarly, in Java, we need to compile the code written by humans into a language that a computer understands (0 and 1) so that the code can be executed. However, in JavaScript, we do not have to do that since the code we write can be directly executed by the web browser. This is because web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that can understand and execute JavaScript code.

## Does code compiling mean that it works correctly?

No, sometimes it will give an output different from what you intended because it checks the syntax and structure of the code, but it does not check the code's logic or correctness.

## How many keywords does Java have?

## How do you print words to the console in Java?

Inside a class, write `System.out.println("anything you want to print")`.
